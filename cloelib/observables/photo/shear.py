r"""Cosmic shear tracer: `ShearTracer`, its Contributions, and its
intrinsic-alignment models.

Compatible with the Tracer protocol. Counterpart to `photo.positions`,
which holds `PositionsTracer`.

Everything needed to build and use a shear tracer - including its
intrinsic-alignment options - lives in this one module:

- `ShearTracer` itself. By default (`ia_model=None`) it has no
  intrinsic-alignment contribution at all - only `LensingContribution`.
  Pass `ia_model="NLA"` explicitly for `NLAContribution` (the nonlinear
  alignment model), or `ia_model="TATT"` for `TATTContribution` below.
- `LensingContribution`, `NLAContribution`: two of the `Contribution`s a
  `ShearTracer` can be built from.
- `TATTContribution` (Eqs. 9-16 of Navarro-Gironés et al. 2026,
  arXiv:2602.16448, "Euclid preparation. CIV. Impact of galaxy intrinsic
  alignment modelling choices on Euclid 3x2pt cosmology"): an alternative
  IA model, selected via `ShearTracer(..., ia_model="TATT",
  tatt_loop_computer=...)`. Its ten one-loop kernels come from a required
  `loop_computer` - `PBJTATTLoopComputer`: real physics, via
  `fastpt.FASTPT.IA_ta`/`.IA_tt`/`.IA_mix` (the `fast-pt` PyPI package - an
  optional dependency, `pip install cloelib[fastpt]`) on the linear matter
  power spectrum. The same three FAST-PT calls, kernel names, and
  `c1**2*Pdd + 2*c1*c1d*D**4*(a00e+c00e) + ...` assembly production CLOE
  used (github.com/cloe-org/CLOE, `cloe/non_linear/miscellanous.py`/
  `pLL_phot.py`) - verified directly against that source. `cloelib`'s own
  `pbjcosmo`-based PBJ interface (`spectro/PBJ_spectro.py`) has no IA/TATT
  support of its own (verified against pbjcosmo 1.6.1's published source:
  its own PT wrapper class subclasses a `fastpt` variant without `IA_*`
  methods), but `pbjcosmo` itself depends on this same `fast-pt` package as
  its PT engine - so this goes straight to `fast-pt`, independent of
  whether `pbjcosmo` is installed. `loop_computer` is a required argument
  (not defaulted to anything illustrative): `TATTContribution` only ever
  reports kernel values it can stand behind as real physics - passing any
  other object exposing the same `.compute(name) -> callable(matter_pk,
  ks, zs)` interface is also supported, for a different PT backend.

Pass `loop_computer=PBJTATTLoopComputer(perturbations)` directly to
`ShearTracer(..., ia_model="TATT", tatt_loop_computer=...)` - one
constructor call, not build-then-replace `.ia`.

See `CONTRIBUTION_ARCHITECTURE.md` for the design this all
follows.

class PBJTATTLoopComputer:
    r"""FAST-PT-backed computer for the ten TATT one-loop kernels.

    Calls `fastpt.FASTPT.IA_ta`/`.IA_tt`/`.IA_mix` on the *linear* matter
    power spectrum at z=0, with the same extrapolation settings and
    `C_window` production CLOE uses (see module docstring). The ten
    outputs are pure functions of k (no z-dependence - `TATTContribution`
    supplies that separately via `D(z)**4` and its C1/C1delta/C2
    amplitudes, exactly matching Eqs. 13-15's own separation of scales), so
    they're computed once per k-grid, cached, and reused across the ten
    named `SpectrumRequest`s (and across `get_Cl` calls, as long as the
    k-grid doesn't change) instead of re-running FAST-PT per kernel name.

    Takes the *same* `perturbations` object you'd pass to `ShearTracer` -
    typically nonlinear (a halo model/emulator backend, for the tree-level
    P_dd term), but FAST-PT's one-loop integrals are only valid starting
    from the linear power spectrum (the same distinction production CLOE
    draws between `Pk_delta` and `Pk_halomodel_recipe`), so this class
    resolves the actual linear source itself: `perturbations.
    linearperturbations` if that attribute exists (every nonlinear backend
    that's built *from* a separate linear one sets it -
    `HMemuNonLinearPerturbations`, `EE2NonLinearPerturbations`,
    `BACCOemuNonLinearPerturbations`, `EmantisFofrNonLinearPerturbations`,
    `JAXNonLinearPerturbations`), else `perturbations` itself *if and only
    if* it's itself a recognized `*LinearPerturbations` backend (see
    `_is_known_linear_perturbations`) - raises `ValueError` otherwise (PR
    #569 review): the absence of a `.linearperturbations` attribute does
    not by itself mean the object passed in *is* linear, and silently
    treating an unrecognized nonlinear backend as linear would be a
    physical error, not a numerical one (FAST-PT would still return
    finite-looking, wrong spectra) - the kind that shouldn't fail silently.
    `CAMBNonLinearPerturbations` is the concrete case this currently
    excludes: it does not set `.linearperturbations` (its own
    `matter_power_spectrum` is always nonlinear), so it now raises here
    instead of being misused - pass `CAMBLinearPerturbations` directly
    instead.

    TODO (PR #569 review): standardize access to the corresponding linear
    perturbations object across nonlinear cosmology backends (e.g. also
    wiring it up for `CAMBNonLinearPerturbations`), so PT-based observables
    can retrieve a linear P(k,z) through one common interface instead of
    this getattr-plus-name-check fallback.

    FAST-PT requires its input k-grid to be evenly log-spaced (an FFTLog
    requirement); `TATTContribution`'s own `ks` (whatever grid the calling
    `AngularTwoPoint.get_Cl` was invoked with, e.g. `perturbations.k` from
    an emulator's extended, non-uniform grid) generally isn't. Production
    CLOE handles this by running FAST-PT on its own dedicated log-uniform
    `k_win` grid and interpolating the results onto whatever `wavenumber`
    is actually needed (`Misc.ia_tatt_terms`'s `interp1d(..., kind=
    'linear', fill_value='extrapolate')`); this class does the same -
    builds a log-uniform grid spanning the requested `ks`' own range,
    runs FAST-PT there, and linearly interpolates (extrapolating past the
    edges, matching production CLOE) back onto `ks`.

    Requires the optional `fast-pt` dependency (`pip install
    cloelib[fastpt]`); raises `ImportError` with install instructions at
    construction time.

        straight into the window because P_II = C1(z)**2 * P_dd(z,k) shares
        P_dd's k-shape), TATT's extra terms have k-shapes (the one-loop
        kernels) that differ from P_dd - so the *amplitude* weighting
        (C1/C1delta/C2) has to move into `get_effective_pk`'s P(k,z)
        assembly instead of living in this kernel.

        The H(z)/c factor is not part of the TATT amplitude functions
        themselves - it's the same "per unit z to per unit comoving
        distance" Jacobian `ShearTracer.get_window_IA`'s NLA implementation
        already folds into its own window (`factor = -Hz/c_0 * ...`).
        Leaving it out here isn't just a simplification: without it, this
        contribution's effective normalisation differs from NLA's by
        (Hz/c_0) per side. Keeping the Jacobian in the kernel (applied
        identically to every contribution pairing) rather than folding it
        into C1/C1delta/C2 separately keeps `get_effective_pk` matching the
        paper's equations exactly, unencumbered by this pipeline-specific
        normalisation detail.
