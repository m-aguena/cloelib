"""Generalized per-contribution-pair spectrum engine.

`contributions.py` gives each tracer's window terms their own `Contribution`
object. Most of them only ever need the plain matter power spectrum P(k,z),
so `AngularTwoPoint.get_Cl` can pair one shared Pk grid against the
tracer-level window sum. TATT breaks that assumption: its `II` (and `GI`)
power spectra are sums of several *distinct* k-dependent terms (Eqs. 13-15
of Navarro-Gironés et al. 2026, arXiv:2602.16448, following Blazek et al.
2019), each needing its own one-loop kernel, not just P(k,z). This module
is the minimal machinery that lets a `Contribution` declare "I need these
extra derived spectra" and get them computed once (and only if actually
needed for the pairing at hand) before the Limber integral runs - the same
principle `toy_cloelib` demonstrates (see its `engine.py` /
`ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md` Sect. 1.2), adapted here without adding new
dependencies (no `equinox`/`plum`): plain dataclasses and a
`getattr(..., default)` lookup, matching how `AngularTwoPoint` already
dispatches on tracer type (`tracer_rules`, `angular_two_point.py`).

Nothing here changes behavior for any `Contribution` that doesn't declare
extra requests: `needs_generalized_engine` returns `False` for them, and
`AngularTwoPoint.get_Cl` keeps using its original, untouched fast path in
that case.
