# cloelib – The Library for the Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid  

**cloelib** is a flexible and efficient library designed to compute cosmological observables for the **CLOE** (*Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid*) project. It is built for seamless integration with **Boltzmann solvers** and **JAX-based frameworks**, enabling automatic differentiation and modularity for the next generation of cosmological analyses.  

We welcome feedback from the **Euclid community** and beyond to refine and improve this library!

## ✨ Features  

🔹 **Intuitive & User-Friendly** – Generate **Euclid-like** observables (e.g., power spectra, window functions, and tracer statistics) in just **3 minutes**!  

🔹 **Automatic Differentiation** – Includes a **toy-example with `JAX`** for gradient-based computations.  

🔹 **Modular & Extensible** –  
- Easily interface with external **Boltzmann solvers** or **emulators** via **Python `Protocols`** following the cosmology.API.
- Core structure enables defining **Background & Perturbation** models, choosing observables via **Tracer** or **SpectroPower** protocols, and computing final summary statistics like **angular power spectra** or **Legendre multipoles**.
