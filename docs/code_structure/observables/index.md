# Observables: Connecting Theory to Observations

The **Observables** module connects theoretical predictions to observational measurements.

This module handles the transformation from theoretical quantities to observable measurements, accounting for survey-specific effects.

## Overview

This module computes survey-specific quantities including selection functions, window functions, and bias parameters that distinguish real observations from idealized theoretical predictions.

This module addresses:

- Window functions for weak lensing surveys and CMB lensing
- Galaxy bias modeling and corrections
- Gravitational-wave source number counts and weak lensing
- Redshift-space power spectra P(k, μ)

## Two Flavors of Observables

**cloelib** has two types of observable protocols, each serving different purposes:

### **Tracer Protocol**

For photometric and gravitational-wave observables

- [Learn more about photometric tracers](photo.md)
- [Learn more about gravitational-wave tracers](gw.md)

### **SpectroPower Protocol**

For spectroscopic observables (3D clustering, redshift-space distortions)

- [Learn more about SpectroPower Protocol](spectro.md)
